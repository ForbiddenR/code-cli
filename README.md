# code-cli

Go utilities for the Claude Code rewrite work.

## Phase 0 API audit

The first command implements the Phase 0 audit for `claude-code-source/src/services/api`:

- list exported symbols from the API service folder
- find external callers outside that folder
- produce a compatibility matrix with keep/replace/remove guidance

Run from this folder:

```bash
go run ./cmd/code-cli
```

Or run against an explicit repository root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/code-cli -repo /workspace/cc
```

JSON output is also available:

```bash
go run ./cmd/code-cli -format json
```

## Phase 1 API contracts

Phase 1 adds normalized Go contracts for the future Claude API boundary:

- `internal/core`: shared message, content block, model, config, usage, and error types
- `internal/anthropicapi`: API-facing request, response, stream event, token-counting, and call option types

This phase intentionally does not implement the API client yet. Client construction, SDK calls, streaming parsing, retries, and error classification come in later phases.
